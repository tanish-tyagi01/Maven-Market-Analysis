# Maven-Market-Analysis
## 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆
I conducted a data analysis project on the Maven Market dataset (269,720 transactions from 1997–1998) to unlock growth opportunities and improve profitability in the retail sector. My aim was to transform raw sales, customer, and store data into actionable insights that can drive smarter decisions in marketing, product strategy, and expansion.
